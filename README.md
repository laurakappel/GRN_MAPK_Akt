This repository provides a model of the MAPK and Akt pathways. 

Parameters and initial values are mainly based on biological assumptions. 
The model is therefore conceptual, and the purpose is to get a better understanding of the interactions between genes, that are important in many cancers including e.g., melanoma. 

The model can be run as a regular R script in the Model.R file. 
Additionally, we created a Shiny app for the model in order to streamline the investigation of important parameter values. In Shiny app.R, you can interactively change the input concentrations of PTEN, BRAF, and NRAS while watching the effect on the main plots.
